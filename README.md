# Deep reinforcement learning on Atari Breakout

This code is based on this publication: https://deepmind.com/research/publications/human-level-control-through-deep-reinforcement-learning/

You can start the code by running the main.py.
Before that:
- If you want to evaluate then change btrain = False in the main.py and set the PATH variable as the PATH to the Neural Network paramters file.
- If you want to train the modell then change btrain = True.
